Contains scripts which can add incremental value to the message of the day (motd) displayed at terminal login

Assumptions:
- Debian Squeeze/Ubuntu 12.04+
- Using update_motd/pam.d (update_motd binary superseded by this in squeeze)

Notes:
- [raid-status] I tried to strip out additional extrenuous information using grep
- [raid-status] This seems useful for systems with < 5 raid arrays running (as it may just overwhelm the terminal like some IRC login motd's)
- [raid-status] Didn't use `cat /proc/mdstat/` because I like the output of mdadm better =]
- [general] Made the update-motd.d scripts like the others there - basically just exec a script instead of have a script written in it

Usage:
sudo cp /<cool-thing-you-want>/##-<script-name> /etc/update-motd.d/ (you may want to re-number the scripts if they don't appear in the order you desire)
sudo cp /<cool-thing-you-want>/<other-script-in-there> /usr/sbin/
Make sure you have update_motd.so enabled in your /etc/pam.d/sshd file
