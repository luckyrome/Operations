Repo Description : A collection of useful things I've made to help with (semi) automation of various services around my computers. Some things will be very silly while others are more useful, like making a dual-boot HTPC possible. 

contained modules:
- dual-boot:
A couple scripts which help me boot to and from Ubuntu/Windows without needing to have access to a physical keyboard.
This helps when I ssh in and need to access something in my Windows environment or I'm RDCd in and I need a Unix 
command line/build environment.

- motd:
A collection of small scripts which all have to do with adding to the message of the day (motd) shown in terminal logins

- scripts:
A collection of smaller scripts which probably aren't big enough to be their own thing (in fact a lot of them can probably just be copied into a big .bashrc or .profile)
